<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rolling Stock Wheel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Casting</li><li>Forged</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rolling stock wheels are typically classified into two main types: casting and forged wheels. Casting wheels are made by pouring molten metal into a mold, allowing for complex designs and lower production costs. On the other hand, forged wheels are created by shaping solid metal through heat and pressure, resulting in a stronger and more durable wheel. While casting wheels are more common due to their cost-effectiveness, forged wheels are preferred in applications where strength and reliability are crucial, such as high-speed trains and heavy-duty freight cars.</p></p>
