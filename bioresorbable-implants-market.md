<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioresorbable Implants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metals</li><li>Polymers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bioresorbable implants are medical devices that dissolve or degrade over time within the body. There are two main types of bioresorbable implants: metals and polymers. Metals such as magnesium and iron are biocompatible and gradually dissolve in the body, eliminating the need for removal surgery. Polymers, on the other hand, are synthetic materials that degrade over time and are often used in orthopedic and cardiovascular implants. Both types of bioresorbable implants offer advantages such as reduced risk of infection and improved patient comfort.</p></p>
