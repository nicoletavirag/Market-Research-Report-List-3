<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reversed-Phase HPLC Columns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Packed Columns</li><li>Capillary Columns</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Reversed-phase HPLC columns come in two main types: Packed Columns and Capillary Columns. Packed columns consist of stationary phase particles packed into a metal or glass column, allowing for higher sample capacity and flow rates. Capillary columns, on the other hand, are smaller in diameter and provide higher resolution and sensitivity due to their increased surface area. Both types of columns are commonly used in chromatography for separating and analyzing compounds based on their hydrophobicity.</p></p>
