<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Deep See Mining Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cobalt Rich Crusts (CRC)</li><li>Manganese Nodules</li><li>Seafloor Massive Sulphides (SMS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Deep sea mining refers to the extraction of minerals from the ocean floor. There are three main types of markets in deep sea mining: cobalt rich crusts (CRC), manganese nodules, and seafloor massive sulphides (SMS). CRC mining involves harvesting layers of cobalt-rich crusts on the seafloor, while manganese nodules are clusters of minerals that can be found in deep sea sediments. SMS mining targets areas with high concentrations of sulfide deposits, which contain valuable metals like copper, gold, and silver. Each market type presents its own unique challenges and opportunities for mining companies.</p></p>
