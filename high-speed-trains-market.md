<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Speed Trains Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wheel on Rail</li><li>Maglev</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High Speed Trains can be classified into two main types based on their operating technology and infrastructure: Wheel on Rail and Maglev. Wheel on Rail high speed trains use conventional steel wheels rolling on tracks to achieve high speeds. On the other hand, Maglev high speed trains use magnetic levitation technology to lift the train off the tracks, reducing friction and allowing for faster speeds. Both types have their advantages and are utilized in different markets based on factors such as cost, speed, and available infrastructure.</p></p>
