<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Asphalt Recycling In-situ Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Mix Regeneration</li><li>Cold Mix Regeneration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Asphalt recycling in-situ equipment can be divided into two main types: hot mix regeneration and cold mix regeneration. Hot mix regeneration involves heating the existing asphalt pavement to high temperatures to reconstitute it into a new hot mix. Cold mix regeneration, on the other hand, uses additives or foaming agents to regenerate the asphalt at lower temperatures. Both methods help reduce the need for new materials, decrease waste, and lower overall costs in asphalt pavement maintenance and construction projects.</p></p>
