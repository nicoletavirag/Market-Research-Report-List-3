<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bacteriophages Therapy Service Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lytic</li><li>lysogenic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bacteriophage therapy services can be classified into two main market types: lytic and lysogenic. Lytic bacteriophages target and destroy bacterial cells by injecting their genetic material and replicating within the cell until it bursts, killing the bacterium. On the other hand, lysogenic bacteriophages integrate their genetic material into the host bacterial cell's DNA without immediately killing it, potentially providing long-term protection against infection. Both types of bacteriophages offer promising solutions for combating antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.</p></p>
