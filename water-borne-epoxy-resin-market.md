<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water-borne Epoxy Resin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Molecular Weight</li><li>Low Molecular Weight</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Water-borne epoxy resins are classified into two main types based on their molecular weights: high molecular weight and low molecular weight. High molecular weight water-borne epoxy resins have longer polymer chains, resulting in higher viscosity and better mechanical properties, making them suitable for applications requiring high performance and durability. On the other hand, low molecular weight water-borne epoxy resins have shorter polymer chains, leading to lower viscosity and faster curing times, making them ideal for applications where quick drying and ease of application are important.</p></p>
