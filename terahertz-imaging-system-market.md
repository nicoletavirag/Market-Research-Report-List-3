<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Terahertz Imaging System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Terahertz Imaging</li><li>Active Terahertz Imaging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Terahertz imaging systems can be classified into two main types: passive terahertz imaging and active terahertz imaging. Passive terahertz imaging works by detecting natural terahertz radiation emitted by objects, while active terahertz imaging uses an external terahertz source to illuminate objects and then detects the reflected signals. Passive systems are generally used for security screening and surveillance applications, while active systems are commonly used in medical imaging and material characterization. Both types of systems have unique advantages and disadvantages depending on the specific application requirements.</p></p>
