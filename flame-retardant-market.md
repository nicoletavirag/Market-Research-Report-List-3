<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Decabromodiphenyl Ether</li><li>Brominated Epoxy Resin</li><li>Brominated Polystyrene</li><li>Halogen-free Flame Retardant</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flame retardants are categorized into several types based on their chemical composition and how they work to inhibit the spread of fire. Decabromodiphenyl ether, brominated epoxy resin, and brominated polystyrene are examples of halogenated flame retardants, which release flame-inhibiting gases when exposed to heat. Halogen-free flame retardants, on the other hand, do not contain halogen elements like bromine or chlorine, making them more environmentally friendly. Other types of flame retardants may include phosphorous-based or intumescent agents, each offering different methods of fire protection.</p></p>
