<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Specific Gravity Separators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Blow Type</li><li>Air Suction Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Specific Gravity Separators are widely used in industries for separating materials based on their specific gravity. The two main market types for these separators are Air Blow Type and Air Suction Type. Air Blow Type separators use a fan to blow air through the material, causing lighter materials to rise to the top and heavier materials to sink to the bottom. On the other hand, Air Suction Type separators use suction to pull lighter materials up and heavier materials down, resulting in effective separation of materials based on their specific gravity.</p></p>
