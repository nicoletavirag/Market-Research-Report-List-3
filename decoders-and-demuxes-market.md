<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Decoders and Demuxes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>3-State</li><li>Open Collector</li><li>Totem-Pole</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Decoders and Demuxes come in three market types: 3-State, Open Collector, and Totem-Pole. 3-State decoders allow an output to be in one of three states: high, low, or high impedance. Open Collector decoders have an open-collector output, meaning they can sink current but not source it. Totem-Pole decoders use a combination of both pull-up and pull-down resistors to control the output. Each market type offers unique advantages and applications depending on the specific needs of the design.</p></p>
