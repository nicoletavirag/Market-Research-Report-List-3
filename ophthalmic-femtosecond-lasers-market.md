<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ophthalmic Femtosecond Lasers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Full Femtosecond</li><li>Half Femtosecond</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ophthalmic femtosecond lasers are divided into two main types: Full Femtosecond and Half Femtosecond. </p><p>Full Femtosecond lasers utilize femtosecond technology for both flap creation and corneal reshaping during procedures such as LASIK surgery. This type of laser offers increased precision and improved outcomes for patients.</p><p>Half Femtosecond lasers use femtosecond technology for flap creation only, while the corneal reshaping portion of the procedure is done with a different type of laser. This approach still provides some of the benefits of femtosecond technology while potentially reducing costs.</p></p>
