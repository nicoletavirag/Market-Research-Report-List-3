<p><h1>PET & CT Scan Market Size 2024 - 2031 Global Industrial Analysis, Key Geographical Regions, Market Share, Top Key Players, Product Types and Forecast Research Report</h1></p><p><strong>PET & CT Scan Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>PET (Positron Emission Tomography) and CT (Computed Tomography) scans are imaging techniques used in the field of medicine to provide detailed pictures of organs and tissues inside the body. PET scans use a radioactive tracer to measure metabolic activity, while CT scans use X-rays to create detailed images of the body's internal structures. When combined, PET/CT scans provide more detailed information about the body than either scan would alone.</p><p>The PET & CT Scan Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.3% during the forecast period. This growth is attributed to the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases, which require imaging techniques for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Additionally, advancements in technology, such as the development of hybrid imaging systems that combine PET and CT scanners in a single machine, are driving market growth.</p><p>The latest trends in the PET & CT Scan Market include the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms to improve image quality and accuracy, as well as the increasing adoption of 3D imaging techniques for better visualization of the body's internal structures. Furthermore, the rising demand for personalized medicine and targeted therapies is expected to further boost market growth in the coming years.</p></p>
