<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CNC Turning Centers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical</li><li>Horizontal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CNC Turning Centers can be classified into two main types: Vertical and Horizontal. Vertical turning centers have the spindle in a vertical orientation, allowing for easier chip evacuation and better visibility of the workpiece. They are typically used for larger, heavier parts and can accommodate larger parts due to their open design. Horizontal turning centers have the spindle in a horizontal orientation, making them more suitable for high-volume production and automation. Horizontal turning centers are often used for smaller, more intricate parts. Both types offer unique advantages based on the specific needs of the manufacturer.</p></p>
