<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Interbody Spacers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polyetheretherketone</li><li>Titanium</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Interbody spacers are devices used in spinal fusion surgeries to maintain the correct spacing between vertebrae. There are two main types of materials used in interbody spacers: polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and titanium. PEEK spacers are known for their radiolucency, biocompatibility, and ability to allow for better imaging post-surgery. Titanium spacers are preferred for their superior strength and durability. Both types of spacers have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific needs of the patient and the surgeon's preference.</p></p>
