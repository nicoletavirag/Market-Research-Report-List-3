<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Change-over Switches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatic</li><li>Manual</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Change-over switches are used to switch between two power sources. Automatic change-over switches automatically switch to the backup power source in case of a power outage, providing continuous power supply without human intervention. Manual change-over switches, on the other hand, require manual switching from the primary to the backup power source. Both types of change-over switches are essential for ensuring uninterrupted power supply in various applications, but automatic switches offer the convenience of automatic operation during power failures.</p></p>
